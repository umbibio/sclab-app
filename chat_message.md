Perfect! I've created a complete SCLab-App setup with Conda Constructor. Here's what I've provided:

## 🎯 Complete Package Structure

1. **Constructor Configuration** (`construct.yaml`) - Main installer configuration with all your dependencies
2. **SCLab-App Package** (`pyproject.toml`) - Separate package that depends on your existing `sclab` package
3. **Cross-Platform Launcher Setup** (`setup_sclab_app.py`) - Creates native launchers for all three platforms
4. **CLI Interface** (`cli.py`) - Provides command-line entry points for different launch modes
5. **Notebook Structure Guide** - Description of what each default notebook should contain
6. **Complete Build Instructions** - Step-by-step guide to create installers

## 🚀 Key Features

**Three Launch Modes**:
- **SCLab-App**: Full JupyterLab with auto-browser opening
- **SCLab-App Dashboard**: Voila-powered dashboard interface  
- **SCLab-App Server**: Server-only mode for manual browser navigation

**Cross-Platform Native Experience**:
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer with Start Menu shortcuts and `.bat` launchers
- **macOS**: `.pkg` installer with `.app` bundles in Applications folder
- **Linux**: `.sh` installer with `.desktop` files for application menu

**Professional Installer Features**:
- Custom welcome screens and branding
- Configurable installation directory (defaults to `~/Documents/SCLab-App`)
- Proper uninstallation support
- Silent installation options for enterprise deployment

## 📁 What You Need to Do

1. **Create the `sclab-app` package structure**:
   ```
   sclab-app/
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── src/sclab_app/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── cli.py
   └── scripts/setup_sclab_app.py
   ```

2. **Create your default notebooks** in the `notebooks/` directory following the structure I outlined

3. **Modify the dashboard notebook creation** in `setup_sclab_app.py` to use your actual SCLab API (currently shows `sclab.create_app()` as a placeholder)

4. **Build and test** using the instructions in `BUILD.md`

The main thing you'll need to customize is the actual SCLab widget integration in the dashboard notebook - everything else should work out of the box! 

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this setup, or do you have questions about how to integrate your existing SCLab widget into this structure?
