# Packaged Resources for SCLab-App

This directory is included in the wheel so post-install can copy default assets and notebooks
onto the end-user system without relying on constructor `extra_files` for directories.

Structure:
- assets/      # icons, images, etc.
- notebooks/   # default/example notebooks
